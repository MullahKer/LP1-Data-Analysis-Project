INDIAN START UP FUNDING ANALYSIS 

In this project I analyse the Indian Ecosystem to give investors feedback on the possibilities of investing in startup companies in india. 

I first as two types of hypothesis:
   1. Null Hypothesis, and 
   2. Alterntive Hypothesis.

   1. Null Hypothesis
      - The sector of setup affect the amount of funding received. 
   
   2. Alternative Hypothesis 
      - Investors' interests in startups are directly correlated with the startup industry. 

I then ask some questions that will enable to dig deep into the data set so that I can give it a critical angle from an investors standpoint:
   1. What industry will our start-up be venturing in?
   2. What will the new start-up be doing?
   3. How much funding are we looking for?
   4. What type of funding are we looking for?
   5. Which industry received the highest amount of funding?
   6. Which location recorded the highest amount of funding received?
   7. What is the average age of start-ups?

I then import the provided data set on jupyter notebook to analyze it with Python libraries including Pandas, Numpy, Matplotli, Pyplot and Seaborn.
